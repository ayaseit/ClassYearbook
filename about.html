<p>  Welcome to the 2016 Class Yearbook for Web Development.
  In this program students learn how to code HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
  The formulas that students learn allow them to design webpages to their satisfaction.
   Students here are learning how to program with the hope that one day it will lead to a rewarding career.
    Jobtrain provides us with all the tools so we can effectively learn Web Developing.
      Jessica Parsons our instructor has 10 years of coding experience and before teaching she was a freelance Web Developer.
       She is an awesome teacher and loves sharing her knowledge of coding with others.
       Itâ€™s a very collaborative yet fun environment. Every Wednesday from 2:15-3:15 PM students have a wellness Wednesday with Veronica Alvarez.
        This is a relaxing way to end the class.
         Also every Friday from 8:30-10:30 AM the students have an essential skills class to help with
         interview and communication techniques as well as goal settings.
        </p>
